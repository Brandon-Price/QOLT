Quality of Life Tracker
------------------------
*Goals of the Project*
Overall is to determine where is the best place to live in the world if you were to have a job in the specific country how much money would you have after all expenses paid for. Comparing the money that is able to be saved, the value of the their currency to goods, as well as benefits that is offered by country.

    - Scrape information from the internet regarding median pay wages for software engineers for various countries. (Primarily in North America and Europe.)
    - Scrape information regarding the cost of living for each of these countries. I.E food, rent (will create a proper metric on the type of apartment and how to determine a good one vs a bad one and creating a median for that), car/walkability, health insurance, taxes.
    - Crime rates, education costs.
    - Using the previous information determine how much a person will have after they pay for their needs and costs.

Possible Things to Consider:

    - Maybe find out how one would be able to immigrate to those countries. In my mind right now it doesn't seem easy to gather that data with code and would probably require me to just look up each country and find out that information on my own.
    - How hard would it be to get a job and get a visa to work there.
    - Negatives of that country (It might be hard to find information that is actually from people that live there.)
    - Possibly historical data would require database.

Tasks:

    - First task is to find a place where I can easily scrape this information, depending on the volume of data I may need to store it into a database.
    - I need to come up with a metric on how I determine what is considered good and bad for things like a good or bad apartment. What is considered NEEDING a car if it is possible to live with no car.
    - Scrape the information and either put it in a database or store the data in a local data structure.
    - Using the python data importing the data into some sort of dashboard.
